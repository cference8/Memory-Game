DGIM 2530 –Memory Assignment 

Inspect memoryTemplate1.hype and memoryTemplate2.hype. The first version does NOT include the shuffle utilizing the setElementProperty code while the second version does. Choose which ever you prefer as your starting point.

All of the following 6 modifications are REQUIRED for your version of Memory:

•	Replace YOUR NAME in the splash scene and also in the credits scene, along with the names of people you want to thank.
•	Replace the cardBack.png in the Resources folder with a different image which is 75px wide by 110px in height. You can either create your own pattern or find an image under creative commons license. See the comments about PNGs in Tumult Hype at the end of step 12 and talk to the instructor if you need clarification.
•	Replace match1.mp3, match2.mp3 & badMatch.mp3 with sounds generated from either Garageband or http://sfbgames.com/chiptone/
•	Modify background and text colors, along with font sizes, font families and other text properties in all three scenes. 
•	Perform two usability tests with two different people. See the usability sheet provided. See below.
•	Host the result on GitHub using the procedure provided

In addition, choose at least 2 of the following 6 optional modifications. Feel free to add more if time permits. 

•	Replace card0.png through card9.png with alternative images. These can either be playing cards or images used in memory type board games designed for young children. Make sure all images are 75px by 110px. 
•	Replace the stencil animation on the splash page with a different animation which moves, scales, fades and/or utilizes other animation techniques. 
•	Replace both background.mp3 for the main scene and credits.mp3 for the credits scene with either music of your own composition or with resources from http://freemusicarchive.org/music/. Make sure to update the credit roll to reflect who composed the music used.
•	Modify the code, if you are using memoryTemplate2.hype, to “deal” the cards in a different order.
•	Find another place to utilize setElementProperty, either in the splash or credits scene
•	Add other code, audio and/or graphic resources not mentioned above. 

For the usability section, please perform each survey with just yourself and the user. Try to get individuals from different backgrounds in terms of age, gender, gaming interest, cultural background, etc. After the user is done, please add your own observations at the bottom of the survey regarding the users reactions, as well as your own suggestions to improve how the game works based on the users feedback. Save the document as Usability-Survey-Simon-STUDENT-USER.docx, replacing STUDENT with your name and USER with the name of the person taking the survey.

Be prepared to present your version to the class in two weeks, as well as your usability results. Upload the following files to D2L:
•	The customized Hype file
•	The compressed HTML folder containing the game
•	Two completed usability test forms
Also, make sure to include the GitHub URL in the comments.
